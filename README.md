# Articles

A collection of short, clear articles written to document what I learn while
working with GitHub, open-source tools, and basic software workflows.

## Topics
- GitHub basics
- Pull requests and collaboration
- Markdown writing
- Open-source contribution workflow

## Structure
Each article is written in Markdown and lives inside the `articles/` directory.

## Goal
To build a habit of writing, learning in public, and maintaining clean GitHub
repositories.
